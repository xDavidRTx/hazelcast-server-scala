:tada: Tiny Hazelcast Server :tada: 

After having several problems with k8s scaling up and down normal Hazelcast clients with vertx (as they store cluster information....) i build this tiny litle "Server" in order to change the scalable instances to Lite clients (they dont have information so nothing to be lost =))
